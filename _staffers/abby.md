Hi all! I've been a Software Engineer at Google for about 5 years now. I spent 3 years working on the Kids Coding Team where I worked on a JavaScript library that supports applications like Scratch, code.org and AppInventor. Currently, I help create fun interactive exhibits that people who come to Google can play with! Outside of work, I enjoy doing random crafty things (like trying to paint my kitchen chairs bright yellow) and exploring the Bay Area. Looking forward to meeting everyone!
