Hi everyone, I'm Paridhi - a Software Engineer at Google and have been working on the Local Search team for over a year now. I graduated from  UC San Diego in 2021 and moved to San Francisco shortly after. I love exploring new places and spending time on crafts! Really excited to be a support system for you this semester and look forward to meeting you all.
