Hi there! My name is Michelle and I'm a SWE based out of Google's office in Cambridge, MA. I graduated from New Jersey Institute of Technology in 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science; while there, I worked at a local startup before interning twice at Google and eventually returning for full time.  Currently I work on Google Cloud Monitoring managing our backend infrastructure and APIs, but I've also worked on Google Shopping and Chromium in the past. Looking forward to meeting you all!
