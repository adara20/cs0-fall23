Hi! My name is Maceo Thompson and I'm a Software Engineer on the Go Security and Reliability team. I was born & raised in Brooklyn, New York, and am lucky enough to also be working in the city postgrad.
I've focused mostly on developer-facing programming, so if you're interested in programming language development, API/SDK development, or generally why you have to do things a certain way I'd love to chat!
If you reach out to me at my google email, please include [CSCI 100] in the subject line.
