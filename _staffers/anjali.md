Hi, I’m Anjali! I’m a software engineer at Google, and I work in the Global Networking team. I’m originally from the San Francisco Bay Area and went to school in SoCal to study data science at University of California, Irvine. I’m currently located in SF and in my free time I enjoy watching new movies/tv shows and going to cool restaurants. Look forward to meeting and working with you all this fall!
