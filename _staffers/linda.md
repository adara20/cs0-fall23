Hello! I work at Google as a software engineer in Workspace Abuse & Safety Protections, which means defending against spam, phishing etc. I grew up in San Jose, went to college at Dartmouth and joined Google as a new grad in 2020. Now I'm back in the Bay Area and living in SF! I like knitting, hiking and streaming the latest reality TV.
