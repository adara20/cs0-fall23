I graduated from Dartmouth College, majoring in both Computer Science and Political Science. For my undergrad thesis, I worked on developing algorithms to gauge public opinions on economic and political situations from social media posts. Currently, I'm a software engineer at Google, working on YouTube. I'm part of the Creator SRE team, where our focus is on building tools that keep YouTube functional for channel owners. This semester, I've taken a bit of a break from my usual work at Google to fully immerse myself in teaching this class. I'm looking forward to a great time together!
