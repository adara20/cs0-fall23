I graduated from Dartmouth College, majoring in both Computer Science and Political Science - an interesting combo, I know! During my time there, I teamed up with professors from both departments for my undergrad thesis. Together, we developed algorithms to gauge public opinions on economic and political situations from social media posts. Currently, I'm a software engineer at Google, working on the YouTube platform. I'm part of the Creator SRE team, where our focus is on building tools that keep YouTube functional for channel owners. This semester, I've taken a bit of a break from my usual work at Google to fully immerse myself in teaching this class. I'm looking forward to a great time together!
