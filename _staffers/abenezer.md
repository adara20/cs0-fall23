I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and a degree in Music. I'm a software engineer at Google, working on YouTube. This semester, I'm taking a sabbatical from my work at Google to come teach this class full-time. You can learn more about me at [www.krentsel.com](https://www.krentsel.com). I'm playing violin in the Howard orchestra this semester.
