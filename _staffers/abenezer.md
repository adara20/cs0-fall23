I graduated from Dartmouth College with a double major in  Computer Science and Political Science. For my undergrad thesis, I worked on developing algorithms to gauge public opinions on economic and political situations from social media posts. After graduation, I joined Google as a software engineer on the YouTube team. I'm part of the Creator SRE team, which is responsible for building tools that keep YouTube functional for channel owners. This semester, I've taken a bit of a break from my usual work at Google to fully immerse myself in teaching this class. I'm looking forward to a great time together!
